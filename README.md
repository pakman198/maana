# Text File reader

This application is a code challenge.

The purpose of the app is to type on a form one of the listed directories
and display all the text files with the number of words contained.
In case of existing a zip file, extract files and process all the text files inside it.

My solution was using nodeJS and React to have a GUI for the user

## Build

```
npm install
npm run dev-all-hook
```
